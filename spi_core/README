INTRODUCTION
------------
This repository serves as the Core modules for the S.I.N data hub. It's primary duty
is to interact with a TI CC1101 RF module, which sends commands in the format of
a sensor board ID, with the coorsponding board transmitting data that is
recieved and placed in a redis queue.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
At the kernel level, it requires binutils, build-essentials, C++, redis, and hredis.
Other modules such as BlackLib and RedisClient (C++ wrapper for hredis) are
included directly in this repository.

RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
If making changes to the master, git is obviously required. In addition, if
running headless, a combination of VIM or EMACS and TMUX make development                  
much easier.
                                                                            
INSTALLATION 
------------                                                                               
Kernel-level installations can be done through installation scripts that reside 
in the config folder. Again, these assume apt-get as a the package manager (for now). 
Production repositories reside said home folder and are never to be directly
developed within, unless an emergency dictates such.                           

CONFIGURATION
-------------
BlackLib SPI will need to be configured via the script in lib. See Makefile for compiled
modules and directives.

Setup script (responsible for setting GPIOs) can be run directly or through the
related make directive.
